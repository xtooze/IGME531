The program is written in C#, and run by running the program.cs file. It then writes the shapes the user has inputed in the WriteSVG function to a .svg file, using the functions found in the DrawFunctions.cs file. I used this to make the recreation, and then also the variation, which is made of circles. I chose to work with circles because it strips the rotational aspect from the piece, which changes how I view it.
